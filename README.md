## Documentation

Coming soon. If you're super impatient, UFOOGLE is built with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), 
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [this guy](https://github.com/profburial/ufo-sightings). 

If you know how to work with those things, you'll probably be [pretty okay](http://i.imgur.com/AXtdjV2.gif).
